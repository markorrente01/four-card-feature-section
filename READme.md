## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design


### What I learned

I learnt how to properly use Grid from this challenge and this particular code did a lot for me because i was stuck for a while
```css
main{
    width: 80%;
    max-width: 90rem;
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
    gap: 4rem;
    margin: 3rem 0;
}
```


### Continued development
Will work on more frontend practice challenges and will use grid more often.

### Useful resources
